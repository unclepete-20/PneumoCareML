# PneumoCareML
Pneumonia classification system using Machine Learning algorithms and Image recognition

### Results
Overall, the model has shown significant progress in terms of accuracy and loss as more training epochs have been completed. However, it is also important to monitor for overfitting and consider techniques such as regularization or learning rate reduction to further improve model performance.

The test set accuracy result was approximately 0.9312, which means that the model achieved 93.12% accuracy in classifying the test set data. This result indicates that the model performs well in the classification task after training in the previous epochs. It is important to note that model performance can vary depending on the nature and distribution of the data in the test set, as well as other factors related to the model and the training process. However, in general, a test accuracy of 0.9312 is quite a positive result.

### Conclusions

The research team has reached the following conclusions based on the research and the results obtained:

* The neural network model shows high accuracy in classifying chest X-ray images to diagnose pneumonia, which could be a valuable tool in the diagnostic process.

* Using a neural network model can streamline the diagnostic process by reducing the need to manually review each image, allowing for faster and more timely diagnosis.

* The neural network model overcomes the limitations of traditional pneumonia diagnostic approaches by detecting subtle patterns in images that can be difficult to identify with the naked eye.

* The neural network model shows high precision, with an accuracy of 93.12%, indicating its effectiveness in detecting pneumonia on chest X-rays. However, limitations and possible misclassification should be considered.

* The successful implementation of the neural network model highlights the potential of artificial intelligence in medicine, which can lead to significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases.
